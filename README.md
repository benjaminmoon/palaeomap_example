# Making Palaeogeographical Maps Using R and GPlates

_Ben Moon_ 2021-03-11

## Introduction ##


This repo includes code for a lab group that I led at the University of Bristol on using R, GPlates, and the Palaeobiology Database to create palaeogeographical maps with fossil occurrences.

The primary file to run is `palaeomap_labgroup.Rmd`, which is an RMarkdown file containing the plan and background for the lab group, and the code to produce the examples. There are exercises and suggested solutions too.

Also in this repo are a short presentation (`palaeomap_presentation{.RMd,.pdf}`) that cover much of the rationale and shows of the plots in the lab group.

This repo is also available on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benjaminmoon/palaeomap_example/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio).

## Lab Group ##

All data and code required for the lab group are included in the repo. Much of this has been exported from GPlates or downloaded from the Palaeobiology Database. There are additional bits that use these services respective web API too. The code can be run on each user's computer or through Binder.
